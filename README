This is a collection of TextExpander snippets I've written or modified.
Right now, it is a collection of one.

googl-shortener.applescript  
    Create goo.gl shortened URL - The "Internet Productivity" bundle that
    TextExpander provides includes several script snippets for shortening URLs.
    I wanted to use Google's shortner, so I wrote this script, which is
    adapted from Smile's bit.ly shortener.

googl-shortener.py
    Create goo.gl shortened URL - I am not really a fan of AppleScript at
    all, so this version of the goo.gl shortener is a python script which 
    can be called from TextExpander as a shell script.  
    Depends on http://code.google.com/p/python-googl/
